## Reflection

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, JS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `vite-react` boilerplate to minimize initial setup. I have used Tailwind css to minimise efforts in writing css.

For unit test cases, I have used Jest with @testing-library/react.
